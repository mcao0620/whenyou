## Project Synopsis
WhenYou is a mobile app dedicated to bringing friends together and spreading joy through live photo responses to funny prompts. Each day, a prompt is released to users and other friends in their group. Users are given a window of time to submit a response to that photo. After the window passes, users then vote on the funniest photo in the group that best fits the prompt and points are accumulated over time, with highlight photos being saved in the app. This offers a way for friends to connect with each other over the simple things that make them laugh on a daily basis while also storing their funniest moments.
